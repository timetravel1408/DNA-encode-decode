# DNA Encoding: Biological Principles

## DNA Structure and Properties

### Basic DNA Structure
- DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is composed of four nucleotide bases:
  - Adenine (A)
  - Thymine (T)
  - Cytosine (C)
  - Guanine (G)
- These bases form complementary pairs:
  - A pairs with T
  - C pairs with G
- DNA strands are antiparallel and form a double helix structure

### DNA Synthesis Constraints

1. **GC Content**
   - Optimal range: 40-60% GC content
   - High GC content (>60%):
     - Increased melting temperature
     - Secondary structure formation
     - Synthesis difficulties
   - Low GC content (<40%):
     - Reduced stability
     - Potential for strand separation

2. **Homopolymer Runs**
   - Maximum recommended length: 3-4 bases
   - Longer runs can cause:
     - Synthesis errors
     - Reading frame shifts
     - Sequencing difficulties

3. **Secondary Structure**
   - Avoid self-complementary sequences
   - Prevent hairpin formation
   - Maintain single-stranded stability

## DNA Data Storage Principles

### Binary to DNA Encoding
1. **2-bit Encoding Scheme**
   ```
